The Final Project - Animal Kingdom provides an opportunity for hands-on experience in defining classes. The task involves crafting a set of classes to delineate the behaviors of various animals within a simulated world. Participants will be furnished with a program executing a simulation of a world inhabited by diverse animals. Distinct types of animals exhibit different behaviors, and the goal is to articulate these distinctions.
